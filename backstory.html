		<h1>The Story of Levi LeMaine</h1>

		<div class="textwall">
			<p>
				Levi LeMaine was born to Loretta and Logan LeMaine in the coal-mining town of
				Cattlerun, New Catalonia in the year 961 By all accounts his youth was unremarkable, growing
				up on a ranch outside of town he managed to largely avoid the coal-mining fever that swept up
				many of the other youths in the burgeoning frontier village. Rough, charming, handsome, and an
				all-around fine boy; that’s what the folks from the village would call him as he matured in a
				strapping young man, the charm of his dark red complexion making him the fancy of more than a
				few of the young women around his home. He’d taken up his mother’s hobby of skeet shooting
				to develop his skills with both a long-barreled rifle and the revolver that he carried at his side for
				settling disputes. From the time he could call himself a teenager he’d already taken remarkably
				well to the life a bona fide cowboy—cards, gambling, horses, and cattle ranching left everyone
				thinking that there was no question, he would be the one to take over the family farm and
				continue the LeMaine ranch on to the next generation. Unfortunately, he would never get the
				chance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Levi died, on the night of the 13th of Midyear, 985. While bringing the cattle home from
				grazing a few hours from home, something startled the cattle and sent them running. With him
				and his horse caught in the middle of a stampede he tried desperately to calm the herd—but to no
				avail. Levi died, his broken body thrown from his horse and trampled, alone and farm from home
				in the radiant desert sunset. But his time on Aarde was not yet up, as fate would have it. His soul
				was snatched from its ascent by a whimsical being, a wanderer of the wastes, an entity of great
				power that offered Levi a deal. His life, for his luck. Levi thought for a long time on if a deal
				with such a being was wise, but ultimately decided that he was not ready for the great beyond
				yet—so a deal was struck. Levi gave to this being his luck, the thing he had so depended on in
				his card games and shooting championships. The creature reached out and plucked a radiant
				droplet of dew from his core—and threw him with some force back to the barren earth on which
				he laid.
			</p>
			<p>
				As he drew in his first breath, he felt as though a piece of him was missing. Such a deal
				may have been a mistake. As he stood examining his repaired body, he turned quickly to see a
				small pack of coyotes approaching him—thinking him a meal—and drew his revolver only to
				hear a dull click. His revolver had jammed. When he made it home, he was covered in claw-
				marks and bites, but carried with him two fresh coyote pelts. His family questioned him
				extensively on what had happened, but he assured them he had simply fallen from his horse and
				had to walk back. He resolved that telling people would only bring unnecessary complications.
			</p>
			<p>
				He would quickly discover that his lack of luck would mean more than never winning
				another hand of cards or game of dice in the saloon in town. He found himself down on his luck
				in every way: when he tried to work his cattle would disappear the moment he turned his head—
				needing a search party to track them down, when he tried to make a little money through
				shooting, his gun would jam at critical moments, or the wind would shift the targets at the last
				moment. When he was finally forced to resort to the bank for a loan to keep his family afloat,
				lady luck betrayed him again and cast him into destitution. After some deliberation he finally
				decided that he would leave the ranch in the hands of his father and capable younger brother.
				They could handle it, at least enough to keep it afloat if he could only get his rotten luck out of
				the way. So, he made certain that the bank knew it was him and him alone who took that loan,
				grabbed his hat, gun and best pair of boots, saddled his horse, and rode out of town.
			</p>
			<p>
				He found himself having to resort to the occasional bounty hunting to get by. A
				dangerous business to be sure, and even worse if one was plagued by a lack of luck, but his
				steady aim, wits, and fast-talking charm got him through it with just a few bumps and bruises.
				All the while he stayed on the run from the law, the bank ever-intent on getting back the money
				they’d loaned him to keep his family’s farm afloat.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last night he found himself desperately in need of a new saddle but hadn’t the money to
				afford it. In a last-ditch effort he decided to rig a game of dice at the saloon in the town he was
				spending the night. It went perfectly, a perfect switch out to his liar’s dice and he played it even
				and cool the entire time only to find… his own cheating dice betrayed him. He lost his horse in
				that bet, leaving him a cowboy without cows, a horse, or even a hat—he’d bet that too. The only
				thing left to him: the boots on his feet and the gun on his hip that his mother had given him near-
				on a decade ago, that was something he’d never give up, not while he still drew breath.
