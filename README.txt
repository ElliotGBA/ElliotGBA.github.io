No references are needed for this, any images are made by me

Asset List:
- LeviFirearm : Photo of Levi's Gun

Very simple file structure, just a file for the photos named "files", a file for the PDFs named "PDFs" and
everything else is contained within the main folder.

Almost everything is reused from previous assignments, I just added on some JavaScript really.

No use of AI or other chatbots.
